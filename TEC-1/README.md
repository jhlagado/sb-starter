# TEC-1

Things related to the TEC-1 computer kit which I designed in 1982 with Ken Stone
and published in Issue 10 of Talking Electronics in early 1983. In particular, the ROMs written by
John Hardy and Ken Stone.

Also the printed circuit artwork by Ken Stone which was based on my original prototype.

Updated with Jim Robertson's enhanced and comprehensive JMON monitor ROM
and also the Utilities / Disassembler ROM also written by Jim in collaboration with Mike Donaghy
